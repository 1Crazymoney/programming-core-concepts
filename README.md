# Core Concepts of Computer Programming 
Of all the inventions in the field of electronics 
like radio and telephone, the programmable computer was the 
turning point for our modern world. It changed the
world forever.

If ever a certain device
can be programmed the way we want it to behave, then 
we can simply instruct it to do things for us.
That's very practical, isn't it?

After the programmable computers emerged, the next
big question was how humans would program these computers.
They had been developing programming languages and 
the 1970s was a very remarkable period: 
the C language was invented.

After the success, the great potential was unleashed
and we are now seeing the things a programmable computer
can do: the era of information, real-time data, 
almost realistic 3D games, artificial intelligence, etc.

Learning computer science now is a very sophisticated
one unlike it was in the past: there are too many 
fields even in software development alone.

And if you are a beginner, you might be discouraged
from all the things you need to learn but don't worry:
**you don't need to learn them all**. What you need
to learn first is the understanding how computers work
and the fundamentals of computer programming that
all computer programming languages have in common.

And since almost every programming language nowadays
directly and indirectly inherits concepts from 
the C language, we'll be using it to demonstrate
the core concepts of programming.
