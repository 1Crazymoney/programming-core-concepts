# Core Concepts of Computer Programming 
Of all the inventions in the field of electronics 
like radio and telephone, the programmable computer was the 
turning point for our modern world. It changed the
world forever.

If ever a certain device
can be programmed the way we want it to behave, then 
we can simply instruct it to do things for us.
That's very practical, isn't it?

After the programmable computers emerged, the next
big question was how humans would program these computers.
They had been developing programming languages and 
the 1970s was a very remarkable period: 
the C language was invented.

After the success, the great potential was unleashed
and we are now seeing the things a programmable computer
can do: the era of information, real-time data, 
almost realistic 3D games, artificial intelligence, etc.

Learning computer science now is a very sophisticated
one unlike it was in the past: there are too many 
fields even in software development alone.

And if you are a beginner, you might be discouraged
from all the things you need to learn but don't worry:
**you don't need to learn them all**. What you need
to learn first is the understanding how computers work
and the fundamentals of computer programming that
all computer programming languages have in common.

And since almost every programming language nowadays
directly and indirectly inherits concepts from 
the C language, we'll be using it to demonstrate
the core concepts of programming.

*Take note: we don't want to discuss every 
detail of the code in terms of the C language, 
rather we just want to get the core
concepts of computer programming that are
common in different programming languages.*

## Input / Output
As was mentioned, a programmable computer is very 
important but the way you interact with the computer
is through input and output: you as the user
will have an input, the computer will process it
(the way it is processed is programmed also),
then the computer will output something.
The very first demonstration is the "Hello World"
program. The programmer will tell the computer
to simply display the message on the screen.

But of course, complex programs are not straightforward
as that. Typical programs like binary
to human language takes a lot of processing,
an operation system to recognize computer applications,
a business collaborative tool with a lot of features
to manage data, a 3D game that is almost realistic,
an Artificial Intelligence that can simulate humans
in the virtual world!

But of all the things programmers can do, the 
computer only process input as binary data
(0s and 1s) and 
it should not be interpreted literally. It's just
a representation of something a computer 
can recognize: high voltage and no voltage.
Imagine any drawing can be accomplished just
by simply using a dot-and-no-dot pattern!
It's the same thing for the computer.

### Hello World Program

```
#include <stdio.h> 

int main()
{

printf("Hello World!\n");
printf("Life is a blessing!\n");

return 0;

}
```

In this small program, the `#include`
tells the computer to include a certain
source which is needed because
it contains the predefined command `printf`.
`printf` simply tells the computer
to display the text provided by the programmer.

As simple as that, you have now the complete
idea of what a programmable computer is all about.
It's you telling the computer to do things it 
can handle in terms of binary data.
